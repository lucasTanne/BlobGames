# Blob Games Instructions
## Resume
Blob Games is the first games of me and [my colleague](https://github.com/AlanJacobdev).
It was developed during the 2nd year of a master's degree in 2D/3D architecture course.<br>
Visit my [colleague website](https://alanjacob.fr/MesArticles/Articles/BlobGame.php) to have more information about the context of the project.

## Installation
First download files from this repository.<br>
Then create a new directory to moved inside the archives.<br>
Now extracts all files to obtain this tree view:
- BlobGames_Data/
- MonoBleedingEdge/
- BlobGames.exe
- UnityCrashHandler64.exe
- UnityPlayer.dll

Finally, run `BlobGames.exe` to start the game.

## Game Goal
To finish the game you must find 2 keys and open double doors to climb on the `pantheon of Blob`.<br>

## Ending word
You can have some bugs because it's our first game and we want to discover maximum gameplay features.

You cannot restart the game from menu so you can exit and restart it.

The most important things is we don't use assets from unity market, because we also want to discover the 3D modeler job and the way to animate an asset. All of the assets (instead of doors and the Terrain) are made with Blender.
